# Developer Setup Guide - project-create-a-comprehensive

This guide helps developers set up their environment for contributing to the "project-create-a-comprehensive" â€“ a citizen services portal.  We recommend using Docker for a consistent and simplified development experience.

## Prerequisites

* **Required Software Versions:**
    * **Docker:** 20.10.0+ (Docker Compose included)
    * **Node.js:** 16+ (with npm or yarn)
    * **Python:** 3.9+
    * **Git:** 2.30+
    * **PostgreSQL:** 14+ (or compatible database as specified in the project)

* **Development Tools:**
    * Git client (e.g., GitKraken, Sourcetree, command line)
    * Text editor or IDE (see recommendations below)
    * A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
    * Postman or similar API testing tool (optional, but highly recommended)

* **IDE Recommendations and Configurations:**
    * **VS Code:** Highly recommended. Install extensions for Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Docker. Configure linters (see Development Workflow section).
    * **PyCharm:**  Good for Python backend development.  Configure Python interpreter and linters.
    * **WebStorm:** Good for Frontend JavaScript development. Configure JavaScript linters and TypeScript support.


## Local Development Setup

### Option 1: Docker Development (Recommended)

1. **Clone Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd project-create-a-comprehensive
   ```

2. **Docker Setup Commands:** Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed and running.

3. **Development `docker-compose.yml` Configuration:**  The project will include a `docker-compose.yml` file.  This file defines the services (database, backend, frontend) and their dependencies.  A sample might look like this:

   ```yaml
   version: "3.9"
   services:
     db:
       image: postgres:14
       environment:
         - POSTGRES_USER=myuser
         - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypassword
         - POSTGRES_DB=mydatabase
       ports:
         - "5432:5432"
     backend:
       build: ./backend
       ports:
         - "8000:8000"
       depends_on:
         - db
       environment:
         - DATABASE_URL=postgres://myuser:mypassword@db:5432/mydatabase
     frontend:
       build: ./frontend
       ports:
         - "3000:3000"
       depends_on:
         - backend
   ```

4. **Hot Reload Setup:**  The frontend build process (e.g., using webpack or Parcel) will typically include hot reloading.  Check the `frontend` directory for configuration instructions.


### Option 2: Native Development

1. **Backend Setup:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Frontend Setup:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Database Setup:** Install PostgreSQL locally. Configure the database according to the instructions in the `backend` directory (likely involving creating a database and user).


## Environment Configuration

* **Required Environment Variables:** The `.env` file will contain sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, and other secrets.  **Never commit this file to version control.**  A sample `.env` file might include:

   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/database_name
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000  # URL for frontend (if separate)
   # ... other environment variables ...
   ```

* **Local Development `.env` File Setup:** Create a `.env` file in the root directory and populate it with your local development settings.

* **Configuration for Different Environments:** The application should use environment variables to handle different configurations (development, staging, production).  This usually involves adjusting the `.env` file or using a configuration management system.


## Running the Application

* **Start Commands for Development:** (Docker)
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
   (Native)
   ```bash
   # Start the backend server (e.g., using gunicorn or uvicorn)
   # Start the frontend development server (e.g., npm start)
   ```

* **How to Access Frontend and Backend:**  The frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (or a similar port specified in `docker-compose.yml` or your `package.json`). The backend API will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000` (adjust based on your setup).

* **API Documentation Access:**  The project might include API documentation generated by tools like Swagger or OpenAPI. Check the project documentation for access instructions.


## Development Workflow

* **Git Workflow and Branching Strategy:**  Use Gitflow or a similar branching strategy (e.g., feature branches for new features, hotfix branches for urgent bug fixes).

* **Code Formatting and Linting Setup:**  Use a linter (e.g., `pylint` for Python, `ESLint` for JavaScript) and a code formatter (e.g., `black` for Python, `Prettier` for JavaScript) to ensure consistent code style.  Configure your IDE to automatically format code on save.

* **Testing Procedures:**  Write unit tests and integration tests.  Use a testing framework (e.g., `pytest` for Python, `Jest` for JavaScript).

* **Debugging Setup:** Use your IDE's debugger or a command-line debugger (e.g., `pdb` for Python, the browser's developer tools for JavaScript).


## Database Management

* **Running Migrations:** Use database migration tools (e.g., Alembic for SQLAlchemy in Python) to manage schema changes.

* **Seeding Development Data:**  Create scripts to seed the database with sample data for development and testing.

* **Database Reset Procedures:**  Include scripts to easily reset the database to a clean state.


## Testing

* **Running Unit Tests:**  `pytest` (Python) or `jest` (JavaScript) commands.

* **Running Integration Tests:**  Similar commands to unit tests, but focusing on interactions between different components.

* **Test Coverage Reports:** Use tools like `coverage` (Python) or `istanbul` (JavaScript) to generate test coverage reports.


## Common Development Tasks

* **Adding new API endpoints:**  Follow the existing code style and add necessary tests.

* **Adding new frontend components:**  Create new components, update routing, and add styling.

* **Database schema changes:**  Write migrations, update models, and run tests.

* **Adding dependencies:**  Update `requirements.txt` (Python) or `package.json` (JavaScript) and run the appropriate package manager command.


## Troubleshooting

* **Common setup issues:** Refer to the specific error messages and search for solutions online.

* **Port conflicts resolution:** Change the ports used by Docker containers or applications.

* **Dependency issues:** Check `requirements.txt` or `package.json` for conflicts. Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies.

* **Environment variable problems:** Double-check the `.env` file and ensure the variables are correctly set and accessible.


## Contributing

* **Code style guidelines:**  Follow the style guide specified in the project (e.g., PEP 8 for Python, Airbnb style guide for JavaScript).

* **Pull request process:**  Create a branch for your changes, write clear commit messages, and submit a pull request for review.

* **Issue reporting:**  Use the project's issue tracker to report bugs and suggest features. Provide clear and concise descriptions of the issue, including steps to reproduce it.
