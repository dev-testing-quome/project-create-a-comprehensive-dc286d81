## Installation

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd project-create-a-comprehensive
   ```

2. **Backend setup:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Frontend setup:**
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the application:**  Start the backend and frontend separately.  Ensure both are running before accessing the application.

   ```bash
   # Backend (from backend directory)
   uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

   # Frontend (from frontend directory)
   npm run dev
   ```

### Docker Setup

1.  Navigate to the root directory of the project.
2.  Run:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    This will build and start both the frontend and backend containers.


## API Documentation

Once the application is running, you can access the interactive API documentation at:

* **API Documentation:** http://localhost:8000/docs (Swagger UI)
* **Alternative API Docs:** http://localhost:8000/redoc (ReDoc)


## Usage

**(Example -  Replace with actual endpoints and data)**

This section will contain examples of how to interact with key endpoints.  For instance, a permit application endpoint might look like this:

**Endpoint:** `/permits`

**POST Request (Example):**

```json
{
  "applicant_name": "John Doe",
  "permit_type": "Building Permit",
  "address": "123 Main St"
}
```

**Successful Response (Example):**

```json
{
  "permit_id": 12345,
  "status": "Pending"
}
```

More detailed usage examples will be provided in the `/docs` directory within the project.
